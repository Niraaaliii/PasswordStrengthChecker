# Password Strength Checker

The Password Strength Checker is a small JavaScript script that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria. It calculates a score from 1 to 5, with 5 being the strongest.

## Features

- Calculates the strength of a password based on its complexity.
- Provides a visual representation of the password strength using a horizontal strength meter bar.
- Displays a success GIF when the password strength reaches the maximum score of 5.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a password in the input field.
3. Click the "Check Strength" button to evaluate the password.
4. The password strength score and the visual strength meter bar will be displayed.
5. If the password strength reaches 5/5, a success GIF will be shown.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Password Strength Checker by modifying the CSS styles in the `index.html` file. You can also replace the success GIF with your own GIF file by placing it in the same directory and updating the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.
